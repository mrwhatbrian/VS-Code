            HTML <abbr> for Abbreviations
            The HTML <abbr> tag defines an abbreviation or an acronym, like "HTML", "CSS", "Mr.", "Dr.", "ASAP", "ATM".

            Marking abbreviations can give useful information to browsers, translation systems and search-engines.

            Tip: Use the global title attribute to show the description for the abbreviation/acronym when you mouse over the element.

            The contact information can be an email address, URL, physical address, phone number, social media handle, etc.

            The text in the <address> element usually renders in italic, and browsers will always add a line break before and after the <address> element.
