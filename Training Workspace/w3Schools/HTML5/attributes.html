	HTML Attributes

	The href Attribute
	The <a> tag defines a hyperlink. The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to

	The src Attribute
	he <img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page. The src attribute specifies the path to the image to be displayed

		There are two ways to specify the URL in the src attribute:

		1. Absolute URL - Links to an external image that is hosted on another website. Example: src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/img_girl.jpg".

		Notes: External images might be under copyright. If you do not get permission to use it, you may be in violation of copyright laws. In addition, you cannot control external images; it can suddenly be removed or changed.

		2. Relative URL - Links to an image that is hosted within the website. Here, the URL does not include the domain name. If the URL begins without a slash, it will be relative to the current page. Example: src="img_girl.jpg". If the URL begins with a slash, it will be relative to the domain. Example: src="/images/img_girl.jpg".

		Tip: It is almost always best to use relative URLs. They will not break if you change domain.

	The width and height Attributes
	The <img> tag should also contain the width and height attributes, which specify the width and height of the image (in pixels)

	The alt Attribute
	The required alt attribute for the <img> tag specifies an alternate text for an image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed. This can be due to a slow connection, or an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader.

		<!--

			The lang Attribute
			You should always include the lang attribute inside the <html> tag, to declare the language of the Web page. This is meant to assist search engines and browsers.

			Example: <html lang="en">

			Country codes can also be added to the language code in the lang attribute. So, the first two characters define the language of the HTML page, and the last two characters define the country.

			The following example specifies English as the language and United States as the country:
			<html lang="en-US">

		<!-- SUGGESTION

			We Suggest: Always Use Lowercase Attributes
			We Suggest: Always Quote Attribute Values

			The HTML standard does not require quotes around attribute values.

			However, W3C recommends quotes in HTML, and demands quotes for stricter document types like XHTML.

		<h2>We Suggest: Always Quote Attribute Values</h2>
		<h1>About W3Schools</h1>

		<p title=About W3Schools>You cannot omit quotes around an attribute value if the value contains spaces.</p>
		<p><b>If you move the mouse over the paragraph above, your browser will only display the first word from the title.</b></p>
