    HTML Comments
    HTML comments are not displayed in the browser, but they can help document your HTML source code.

    Notice that there is an exclamation point (!) in the start tag, but not in the end tag.

            Add Comments
            With comments you can place notifications and reminders in your HTML code:

        -->

        <h2>Add Comments</h2>
        <!-- This is a comment -->

        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>

        <!-- Remember to add more information here -->

            Hide Content
            Comments can be used to hide content.

            This can be helpful if you hide content temporarily:

        -->

        <h2>Hide Content</h2>
        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>

        <!-- <p>This is another paragraph </p> -->

        <p>This is a paragraph too.</p>

        <h2>You can also hide more than one line. Everything between the &lt;!-- and the --&gt; will be hidden from the display.</h2>

        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
            <!--
                <p>Look at this cool image:</p>
                <img border="0" src="pic_trulli.jpg" alt="Trulli">
            -->
        <p>This is a paragraph too.</p>

            Hide Inline Content
            Comments can be used to hide parts in the middle of the HTML code.

        -->

        <h2>Hide Inline Content</h2>
        <p>This <!-- great text --> is a paragraph.</p>

    </body>
